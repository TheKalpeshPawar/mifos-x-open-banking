/**
 * The serializer used for PISP request bodies.
 *
 * Mirrors the content-negotiation config of the sandbox client, with `explicitNulls = false` so the
 * all-nullable OBIE DTOs emit only the fields that were set — which is what keeps a consumer payment
 * free of the merchant `Risk` fields rather than sending them as explicit nulls.
 *
 * PISP bodies are encoded here rather than handed to content negotiation because the detached JWS
 * must be computed over the exact bytes that are transmitted. Serializing once, signing that object,
 * and sending its `toString()` removes any chance of the two diverging.
